The results depend on exploratory data analysis and data visualization. We focus on the features that may influence people’s decisions toward COVID-19 related events and their importance. An in-depth analysis is performed with different statistical graphics. Since this is a worldwide problem and has captured a lot of attention, the analysis would support us to understand the distribution, association and trends of the relevant features, and people’s behavior and attitudes during this period.

There are very few rows missing demographic information and COVID-19 threat index including fear of COVID-19 and protective actions. Hence, in our future analysis, if we would like to analyze the reasons that cause the hesitation of taking COVID-19 vaccination among the homelessness, the missing data might reduce the power of analysis and conclusion on this problem. Moreover, we focused on the trend of the missing values and the possible relationship between the variables and NAs, especially for the reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the response of whether taking vaccine if offered one. The bar plots show that the percentages of missing values are higher among the data collected from the older people. 4.2 Vaccination by Race Based on missing value heatmap, the pattern of missing values can be clearly observed and summarized. The x axis is the percentage of people with different race who got vaccinated, and y axis contains the states. There are 7 states in total having missing values. There are missing values for every columns, and the missing pattern of percent of black vaccinated and percent of white vaccinated are the same. In other words, if values missing in the former, then the missing values are more likely to appear the later one. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 General results 5.2 Case study: vaccine attitudes among people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles in 2021", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 General results Based on the average income map, the pattern of the whole U.S. average income distribution geographically is observable. The range defined is from 20,000 dollars to 55,000 dollars per person every year. The regions with relatively high average income are located in northeastern America, and always concentrated on several adjacent states. We explore the population with low education level measured using the rate of people above 25 years old who have not finished their high school education as the index. The map plot shows the percentage of people above 25 without high school diploma is larger in the south of America than which in the north of America. There is a proper guess that the family education are more popular and developed in wealthy states rather than school education. To quantitatively describe the average income and education level, two dimensional scatter plot presents the association between them. There is a obvious negative association between them, which means when education level of people is lower, the income they earn would be lower. The COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates are always greater than 0.5, and there are apparent geographic correlation and distinction. More specifically, vaccination coverage rates are extra high in the northeastern and adjacent states, while people do not show a such strong willing to accept the vaccine. Moreover, the distribution of the vaccination rates are positive related to the distribution of average income above. ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## STATE perc_without_hs avg_income `percent of white vac~` `percent of bl~` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Alabama 0.097 23073. 0.49 0.51 ## 2 Alaska 0.047 32531. 0.56 0.61 ## 3 Arizona 0.088 23459. 0.6 0.51 ## 4 Arkansas 0.092 22443. &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 California 0.114 32090. 0.75 0.66 ## 6 Colorado 0.058 30695. 0.78 0.73 ## # ... with 2 more variables: `percent of Hispanic vaccinted` &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `percent of Asian vaccinted` &lt;chr&gt; In order to learn about the death rate in COVID-19 pandemic among total 4 U.S. Census Regions, facet plot shows the relationship between death rate, poverty rate and education level. A positive correlation between death rate and poverty rate shown in the South and West Census Region, while Middle and North Census Region has no apparent trend. In addition, all the plots suggest a positive association between education level and death rate. 5.2 Case study: vaccine attitudes among people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles in 2021 In this section, we would specifically pay attention to the attitudes toward COVID-19 among the homelessness in Los Angeles and deal with the demographic data and binary response collected from a related survey. The observable relationship will be presented and concluded below with the statistical graphics. Based on the following mosaic plots, it is observable that females are more likely to be anxious about getting COVID-19 than males. People who are doubled up and live in hotels are less worried about COVID-19 than those who are sheltered or unsheltered. With this limited data, the boxplot presents a increase in COVID-19 protective score among people have been experiencing homelessness for a longer time. When the fear score increases, the hesitancy of taking vaccine decreases. We can also see a relatively positive relationship between fear score and COVID-19 protective score. People are more likely to follow the protective instructions and take action if their fear score is higher. 5.2.1 Analysis of Hesitancy of Vaccination among Homelessness based on Limited Response From the bar plot below, the most popular reason of hesitating to have COVID-19 vaccine is the concern and fear of unpleasant vaccination side effects. People also cared about getting more information first before actually taking the dose and some of them refused to get any vaccine, not just COVID-19’s. The data also contains the response of the question that if the vaccination is provided, whether people would take it. Depending on the plot, we can indicate that people experiencing homelessness who said “Yes” to this question have shown no hesitance in taking vaccination, while those who answered “No” or “Preferred not to answer” had such hesitation. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Relationship betweeen social vulneraibility factors, COVID-19 deaths rate and vaccination rate 6.2 Relationship between average income, race, and vaccination rate", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Relationship betweeen social vulneraibility factors, COVID-19 deaths rate and vaccination rate Parallel coordinates plot is interactive and dynamic to compare the correlation of the paired features. In order to explore the relationship between different variables, y axis is set for all the states and x axis refers to different features. With the graphs we created before, the relationship between features could be roughly described, but parallel coordinates plot brings stronger evidence to prove that they are actually correlated. For example, the parallel coordinates plot indicates that there is a negative correlation between avg_income(average income) and non_hs_rate(the percentage of people who do not have high school diploma). The interesting point we can find is that non_hs_rate has a negative correlation with vaccination rate, which is a meaningful result to show the education can actually influence people to make their decisions about whether to get vaccinated or not. In other words, people with higher education level are more likely to take vaccination. 6.2 Relationship between average income, race, and vaccination rate This graph is focusing on deeply explore the correlation between average income and the race among people who are vaccinated. The goal is to figure out whether different income amount will influence people’s decision of getting COVID-19 vaccine by race. There are different decision making pattern shown by selecting the given race line you are interested in. For instance, there is an apparent rising trend for white people, which presents income increase can give white people stronger confidence or more motivation to get vaccinated. However, the income increase may not play an such important role in decision making about vaccination among Asian. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Q&amp;A 7.2 Next step", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Q&amp;A Through the exploratory data analysis and statistical data visualization, many interesting insights into the COVID-19 effect are obtained. The main questions that were wished to be answered at the beginning of the project are summarized: What are the geographic distributions of education level, average income and vaccination rates in U.S.? The relatively high average incomes are concentrated on neighboring states in the Northeastern U.S. lower levels of education are higher in the south than in the north of U.S. Vaccination rates are very high in the Northeast and neighboring states, while rates are relatively low in the middle of the country. Are there any association between education, poverty level and vaccination rate? Yes, the vaccination rate is influenced by levels of education and poverty. It is also distinct in different regions. Are there any relationship between the features that we are interested in, including death rate, Census Region, average income, education levels, unemployment rate, poverty rate, vaccination rate? By creating a interactive plot, the correlations are displayed clearly, some of them have strong associations such as education levels and average income. The vaccinated rate, which is the key feature that we focus on, is negatively associated with poverty rate and death rate. Would income increasing guide people with different races to decide whether to get vaccinated or not? We observed that the vaccination rates among ethnic groups are positively correlated with average income in White, Black and Hispanic, but not among Asian. Is there a different relationship between death rate and poverty rate, as well as education level with death rate in different Census Region? Southern and Western Census Region has a strong positive correlation between death rate and poverty rate, while Middle and Northern Census Region has no apparent association. All of Census Regions show positive association between education level and death rate. 7.2 Next step After learning about the big picture, the next step could be focusing on the specific region and analyzing the perspective toward COVID-19 and vaccination among people with social vulnerability. The analysis about the attitude of COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles can definitely be considered as a sample for the further study.
